## The Story

It's 2020, the year that gripped the world at its fingertips. I'm talking about the COVID pandemic. If you are here from years into the future, I hope the world is back to normal. As of now, it's almost 16 months into isolation, and all of my education is now online. As an introvert, I quite fancied myself to be "fine", But yeah, even I struggled. During the first few months of staying at home, all I did was study, spend time with family, binge watch TV series and play video games all day. With time as you can imagine, it was boring. I wanted to do something else, I wanted to create something.

> "I wanted to create something."

I guess it's the engineer inside me talking. Speaking of which, I am an aerospace engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology. And my mindset of being on a quest to make something. I stood up, looked around and thought deeply. In my mind, I had *nothing*—this wasn't the lab or workshop like at campus it's just a bedroom. I can't even go outside because of the pandemic. All I had was my Laptop (*Jarvis*).

I didn't know how to code, I took an introductory programming course at college, but we never really made anything. To add, I should also say that I feared coding in general. It all seemed too complicated for me. But it was time; I had to beat the fear. If I was to make something cool/practical/fun, I've got to learn to code.

>"So, I did."

In June, 2020 I started learning python. Its a basic language that can be used to build cool things (this is all I knew about it). And fast forward a year and a bit, I'm here now. I've enjoyed my journey in the last year. Of course, it isn't by any means over. Over the last few months, I was thinking about this, and I finally got to do it right now. I created this blog to start documenting my journey. My idea is that I write about my projects, resources that helped me, and, of course, my mistakes. I will try to keep this blog informative, but I'm pretty new to writing. If you are still reading this, then, *"Hi there, thank you for spending the time to know me"*.

Feel free to send me an email or reach out to me on any of my social channel's. I would love to hear your feedback. With that, Peace out!
